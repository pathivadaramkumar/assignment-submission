Docker file:
step 1: install Docker
#to connect to the server i used mobaxtream
step 2:creating a Docker file

# Use an official WordPress image as the base image
FROM wordpress:latest

# Add any necessary labels
LABEL maintainer="Ramkumar <pathivadark68@gmail.com>"

 EXPOSE 80  (#exposing the application on port this port)

 # Define the command to start the WordPress application
CMD ["apache2-foreground"]

##eplanation
Installing docker in machine(servers)
+ FROM wordpress:latest: This line specifies that you're building your custom image based on the official WordPress image, which is available on Docker Hub.
  
+ LABEL maintainer="Ramkumar <pathivadark68@gmail.com>": This is an optional label for metadata. It indicates the maintainer of the image.
  
+ EXPOSE 80 is an optional line that exposes port 80, which is the default HTTP port used by WordPress. If you're using Docker without a reverse proxy, you can use this to expose the port.
  
+ CMD ["apache2-foreground"] specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs the Apache web server as the foreground process, which is the default for WordPress

+ This Dockerfile allows you to build a custom WordPress image with specific configurations and environment variables, making it easier to manage your WordPress application within a Docker container.

+ $docker build -t 'wordpress-image' this is the command used to create image from the Dockerfile.

##Docker compose.yml

+docker compose is used in multi continer architecture.here is two services wordpress and mysql .

+two containers are going to create while running the yaml file. the two container are linked with each other.

+version: '3': This line specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format using. Version 3 is commonly used and offers a range of features and compatibility.

+environment: Sets environment variables for configuring the WordPress application, including the database connection details.
setting up the environment to both the services like users and passwords to link up with each other.

+volumes: Defines a named volume to persist WordPress data files. using of persistant volume because containers are permenant may they get vanish at any time so ws use volume to store the data of the aapplication.

+depends_on: Specifies that the wordpress service depends on the db service, ensuring that the database container starts first.

+the docker adhoc commands use create the containers in docker compose yml.
$docker run --name mysql-cont -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ram@2000 -d mysql:5.7
$docker run --name wp-cont --link mysql-cont:mysql -p 8000:80 -d wp-image

+With this docker-compose.yml file, you can use Docker Compose to easily deploy a WordPress application with a MySQL database. Simply run docker-compose up -d in the directory containing this file to start the services in detached mode, making your WordPress site accessible on port 8080 of your host machine.
